//! Keyed CUDA graphs: one captured executable per key (a family's fixed launch sequence: rows bucket x context
//! bucket, ...), launched again whenever the key comes back. Family-agnostic: the caller names the key, the body that
//! issues the launches, and the fingerprint of the addresses the body bakes in.
//!
//! - First use captures the body (nothing runs while capturing) and launches the graph: the step's result is the
//!   graph's. A key that cannot be captured runs the body eagerly instead; the result is the same by the body's
//!   contract (a graph replays the eager launch sequence).
//! - Ranks agree: with an `Agree` hook (tensor parallelism, lanes), every decision a rank could take alone (room for
//!   one more graph, a capture that failed) is AND-ed over the ranks before it is acted on, so every rank captures,
//!   evicts and falls back at the same steps. Ranks meet the same keys in the same order, so hits and LRU evictions
//!   agree without a round trip. `Agree` is never called during a capture.
//! - Fingerprint: a body's graph holds the device addresses it captured. A changed fingerprint (a buffer reallocated)
//!   drops every graph; they are captured again on use.
//! - Cap: at most `max` graphs; a capture past it first evicts the least recently launched. Under the caller's memory
//!   floor (`room` false on any rank) the least recent quarter is evicted, the cap drops to what is left (never below
//!   `min_keep`) and the step runs eagerly. The next miss with room on every rank puts the cap back to `max`: a memory
//!   dip (a long prompt's prefill workspace held, then freed) must not leave the cache short-capped for good, which
//!   turns every later new key into an eviction and a capture.
//! - A capture that fails on any rank turns graphs off for the rest of the run, every rank alike.
//!
//! No CUDA here: capture / launch / free go through `Engine` (`cudaEngine` for the driver), so the policy runs in
//! host tests with a fake engine.
