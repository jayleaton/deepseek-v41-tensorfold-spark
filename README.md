# DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-1017 on TensorFold, 2x NVIDIA DGX Spark

![flash17: DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-1017, EXL3 2.8 bpw, now available](assets/flash17-now-available.png)

A recipe for serving DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-1017 on two NVIDIA DGX Sparks behind an OpenAI-compatible API. It ships
our EXL3 pack (**flash17**) and a pinned upstream TensorFold native build. The measurements below describe
the previously deployed engine and profile.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Model | [`deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-1017`](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-1017) |
| Pack | **EXL3 2.8 bpw, 203.8 GB**: [`jayleaton/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-1017-EXL3-2.8bpw`](https://huggingface.co/jayleaton/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-1017-EXL3-2.8bpw) |
| Hardware | 2x DGX Spark (GB10, 128 GB each), tensor parallel 2 over the 200 Gb/s CX7 link |
| Engine | upstream TensorFold, pinned in [`config/tensorfold.rev`](config/tensorfold.rev) |
| Serving | 1M context, four slots, vision (native image input), tool calling, structured output |

This branch migrates the recipe to upstream native serving. The pin includes flash17’s `dsq-1` admission support.
The engine/pack/device qualification is pending; the historical production results below do not qualify this pin.
See [ENGINE](docs/ENGINE.md) for the local checkout/bundle build route and single-pin update procedure.

> **Work in progress.** Measured on one pair of Sparks. Read [what is not solved](docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md) before
> relying on it.

## Results

**Tasks.** 356 matched items (pass@1, greedy, thinking on, effort high), against Mia-AiLab's 2.9 bpw pack and
our previous q28-v2 pack:

| Suite | flash17 | Mia 2.9 bpw | q28-v2 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| HumanEval+ | 34 / 40 | 34 / 40 | 33 / 40 |
| MBPP+ | 50 / 60 | 49 / 60 | 50 / 60 |
| MMLU-Pro STEM | 93 / 100 | 91 / 100 | 90 / 100 |
| MATH-500 | 36 / 40 | 36 / 40 | 36 / 40 |
| SciCode (first step) | 6 / 10 | 6 / 10 | 5 / 10 |
| LiveCodeBench | 16 / 20 | 13 / 20 | 13 / 20 |
| BFCL | 39 / 40 | 39 / 40 | 39 / 40 |
| Tool chains | 6 / 6 | 6 / 6 | 4 / 6 |
| MGSM | 40 / 40 | 40 / 40 | 40 / 40 |

Small samples: every paired 95 % confidence interval includes zero, so these show no statistically significant
difference. Intervals, method and limits are in [FLASH-1017](docs/FLASH-1017.md#task-results-356-items).

**Retention of the 1017 release, as served** (top-1 agreement with the release, with the serving expert pruning):
code **95.17 %**, science **94.93 %**, tools **87.64 %**. The full table, with KL and the other packs:
[FLASH-1017](docs/FLASH-1017.md#fidelity-to-the-release-retention-as-served).

**Speed** at the recommended profile (2.1M pool, 2100 MHz cap), single stream: short decode **87.9 tok/s**; decode
after a 32K / 131K prompt 64.1 / 64.9 tok/s; prompt tokens over time to first token 2,349 / 2,198 tok/s (TTFT includes
HTTP and admission). q28-v2's earlier measurements, under a different clock and its 3.0M pool, were 85.75, 66.7 / 64.5
and 2,630 / 2,460; not a matched A/B. Details: [FLASH-1017](docs/FLASH-1017.md#speed).

**Images and agents** at the recommended profile: VQA 20 / 20 plus 3 / 3 `image_url` probes; a clean OpenCode
session passed (7 valid tool calls, normal stop).

## Quick start

The full guide is [ZIG-SERVE](docs/ZIG-SERVE.md). Build the image and the per-rank assets as it describes, then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jayleaton/deepseek-v41-tensorfold-spark.git
cd deepseek-v41-tensorfold-spark
hf download jayleaton/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-1017-EXL3-2.8bpw --local-dir /srv/models/flash17   # both nodes
cp config/prod-zig-flash17.env.example config/prod-zig.env && $EDITOR config/prod-zig.env    # both nodes
scripts/run-zig.sh 1 --check-aot   # after generating assets; compare both rank identities before starting
```

- Fill in the node paths and link settings from
  [`config/prod-zig-flash17.env.example`](config/prod-zig-flash17.env.example) and keep its engine settings. It needs
  the **2.1M-token pool** (`TF_DSV41_POOL_TOKENS=2100000`). With q28-v2's 3.0M pool this pack goes under the 4 GiB
  memory floor during 4K prefills ([why](docs/FLASH-1017.md#memory-the-21m-pool)).
- Pack the **1017 Engram shards** with `scripts/pack_engram.py` ([Engram setup](docs/INSTALL.md#engram-source-setup-68), with
  `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-1017` as the source); the September shards do not match this pack.
- We suggest a 2100-2200 MHz GPU clock cap (`nvidia-smi -lgc 300,2100`) to help with temperature control.
- Check the answer to `What is 17 * 23?` is 391 before serving traffic.

## Rollback to q28-v2

The previous pack, q28-v2
([`jayleaton/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-EXL3-2.8bpw`](https://huggingface.co/jayleaton/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-EXL3-2.8bpw)),
keeps its own unchanged profile, [`config/prod-zig.env.example`](config/prod-zig.env.example) (September Engram shards,
3.0M pool). Stop rank 0, then start both ranks with that config:
[FLASH-1017, rollback](docs/FLASH-1017.md#rollback-to-q28-v2). Its measurements are in
[PREVIOUS-RESULTS](docs/PREVIOUS-RESULTS.md).
