# DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash on TensorFold, 2x NVIDIA DGX Spark

The recommended pack is **q28-v2 EXL3 2.8 bpw**:
[`jayleaton/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-EXL3-2.8bpw`](https://huggingface.co/jayleaton/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-EXL3-2.8bpw)
(publication pending; repository name provisional). Serve across two NVIDIA DGX Sparks, TP=2 over the 200 Gb/s CX7
link, behind an OpenAI-compatible API.

The new [CUDA Zig serving path](docs/ZIG-SERVE.md) is based on TensorFold 1.0.2 plus the DeepSeek CUDA port.
Its recommended all-on settings and optional 4K prefill are documented there. **The port's source export and generated
AOT assets are not bundled in this repository yet**; the build recipe needs those inputs. The existing Python
recipe remains TensorFold 0.6.0 plus the two published patches, with exact DSpark speculative decoding, CED replay,
four request slots, NVMe sessions, native image input, structured output and tool calls. The shipped Python patches
predate the q28-v2 ragged-expert loader; keep their original 2.9 bpw pack until that engine update is exported.

> **Work in progress.** Measured on one pair of Sparks, against one baseline. Read
> [what is not solved](docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md) before relying on it.

## Current q28-v2 results: Zig vs Python

Two DGX Sparks, TP=2, q28-v2. **Zig numbers are single-run measurements**, without confidence intervals.
The recorded Python short-decode reference selects the best of three repetitions; long and mixed-load cells have
one measurement per engine. A short warm-up precedes the suite, rather than a separate warm-up of every cell.
All compared reply hashes match the Python reference, including T0.7. [Evidence and method](docs/ZIG-RESULTS.md).

| Cell | Python reference | Zig (all-on) |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| code ×1 | 86.6 | 87.6 |
| code ×4 | 145.4 | 147.4 |
| code T0.7 ×1 | 92.2 | 90.0 |
| code T0.7 ×4 | 147.0 | 144.8 |
| prose ×1 | 54.2 | 54.4 |
| prose ×4 | 99.0 | 98.3 |
| prose T0.7 ×1 | 50.4 | 49.2 |
| prose T0.7 ×4 | 98.2 | 99.0 |
| mix: 4 streams | 140.0 | 141.8 |
| mix: 131K decode | 69.0 | 67.2 |
| 32K decode | 51.1 | 61.1 |
| 131K decode | 53.4 | 64.1 |
| 32K prompt (tok/s) | 2,436 | 2,507 (2,663 with PF_4K) |
| 131K prompt (tok/s) | 2,266 | 2,318 (2,486 with PF_4K) |

Zig is about **20% ahead on long-context decode**, and 4K prefill is about **9–10% ahead on prompts**.
Short decode is roughly at parity. It is still slightly behind on sampled T0.7 cells overall (prose ×4 is ahead)
and mixed long decode; it does not beat Python everywhere. PF_4K is optional and falls back to 2K when either rank
lacks workspace headroom. PIECE_RUNS stays gated and off.

## Historical 2.9 bpw results: Python vs vLLM

The following tables retain the original measurements and pack. They are **not a q28-v2 vLLM comparison**;
there are no new vLLM measurements for the Zig path here.

Two DGX Sparks (GB10, 128 GB each, one QSFP cable, RoCE), weights
[`dealignai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-UNCENSORED-EXL3-2.9bpw`](https://huggingface.co/dealignai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-UNCENSORED-EXL3-2.9bpw).
Baseline: [MiaAI-Lab's 2x DGX Spark vLLM kit](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/DeepSeek-v4.1-Flash-EXL3-2x-DGX-Sparks) on
the same pair and weights. Ours: [`config/prod.env.example`](config/prod.env.example) on engine `7bd2d67` (G19).

### Speed (tok/s)

| | **TensorFold (this recipe)** | MiaAI-Lab vLLM kit | ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Code, 1 stream, greedy | **84.7** | 41.9-45.0 | **1.9-2.0x** |
| Prose (essay), 1 stream, greedy | **46.8** | 32.5 | 1.44x |
| Structured (count 1-200), 1 stream, greedy | **121.3** | 38.0 (50.2 on a JSON task) | **2.4-3.2x** |
| 1 stream, decode aggregate | **87.6** | 32.2 | **2.7x** |
| 2 streams, decode aggregate | **74.1** | 46.7 | 1.59x |
| 4 streams, decode aggregate (steady, all four live) | **101.1** (136.0) | 37.6 | **2.7x** |
| Cold prefill 8K / 32K / 64K / 128K (CED replay, the default) | **2,028 / 2,310 / 2,294 / 2,118** | 1,073 / 1,075 / 1,060 / 1,031 | **1.89-2.16x** |
| Cold prefill, `TF_DSV41_PREFILL=full` (exact: no replay) | **1,561 / 2,025 / 2,197 / 2,152** | same | **1.45-2.09x** |
| Start to ready | **34-44 s** | 378 s | ~9x |

Decode: mean of 2 boots of the shipped build. Prefill: 8K / 32K on the shipped `TF_DSV41_PREFILL_ADAPT_GIB=4.5`,
64K / 128K on the soaked 4.0. Start to ready not re-measured since G11.

### Quality and robustness

| | **TensorFold** | kit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Teacher-forced top-1 agreement with the kit (8 prompts x 2,048 positions) | **0.9961** (first copy of each prompt: 0.9502); the same with every G13-G17 lever on or off | 1 by definition |
| MMLU-200, 0-shot, greedy, thinking off | **87.5%** | 87.5% |
| MMLU-200 with a 20-question preamble (~2.1K-token prompts), replay vs full prefill | 81.1% / 81.1% (178 of 180 answers equal) | - |
| Needle at 32K / 128K / 299K (replay prefill) | found (19.9 s / 74.0 s / 195 s) | - |
| Multi-step tool chains (`bench/tooleval/chains.py`, 6 scenarios, 12 points), thinking off / high | 11 / 12, 11 / 12 | - |
| tool-eval-bench category C (multi-step), thinking off | 8 / 8 (score 100) | - |
| Structured output: 12 JSON-schema cases + 10 tool-choice cases (drafted == serial == batched, valid, no markup) | 22 / 22 | - |
| Image input (native: DeepSeek's ViT on rank 0): 20 visual questions | 20 / 20 | - |
| 1 h soak (agent sessions to 120K tokens with screenshots, short chats with cancels, 24-200K prompts, image requests) | **906 requests, 0 errors**, 0 capacity refusals; RssAnon falling (-0.4 GiB/h a rank); MemAvailable min head 4.63 / worker 3.99 GiB | - |
| Stress: one 299K prefill + three 64K prompts decoding 2,048 tokens each + 4 image requests | every stream completes; 299K first token **157 s**; MemAvailable min head 5.07 / worker 4.81 GiB | 4.40 GiB at <= 256K (lighter load) |

Every run checks **drafted == serial**, **batched == alone**, and bit-identical outputs across prefill row sizes. How
each cell was measured, what is exact and what is approximate, and strict mode: [`docs/METHOD.md`](docs/METHOD.md).
